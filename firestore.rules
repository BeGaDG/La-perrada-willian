/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for La Perrada de William.
 *
 * @corePhilosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for orders, where users can only access their own order data, combined with public read access to the product catalog.
 * @dataStructure Data is organized into top-level collections for 'products', 'orders', and 'customers'. Order items are stored as subcollections under each order.
 * @keySecurityDecisions Public read access is granted for products to allow unauthenticated menu viewing. Orders are secured based on customerId, with create access allowed for authenticated users and read/write access restricted to the order owner.
 * @denormalization The `orders` collection denormalizes customer data (`customerName`, `customerPhone`, `customerAddress`, `customerId`) to enable authorization without requiring additional reads to the `customers` collection. This improves performance and maintains authorization independence.
 * @structuralSegregation Publicly readable product data is separated from private order data, which is secured by customerId.
